Movies website : 
I used C#11 & .Net 7 with EF 8 and microsoft identity.
The user can see all the movies from home page and search for any movie he want.
User can add / remove movies into the shopping cart and finally can pay using the paypal payment method.
The application has two roles admin,user.
Admin manages all movies including add, update and remove them.
Admin also manages roles and all users.
Admin can see all completed orders.
